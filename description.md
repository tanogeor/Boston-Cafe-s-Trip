Boston Coffee Shops and the Travelling Salesman

# Introduction
The travelling salesman problem has worried logistics managers and route planners for quite a long time now.
The optimization of FTL (Full-Truck-Load) mileage is the key questions to be answered
For reasons of simplicicty, though, this study will focus on minimizing the miles of a truck's full circle
of their delivery points without taking the full truck load aspect into consideration.

Boston is a very vivid metropolis of the state of Massachusetts. Coffee, as in many other cities of the USA, is
loved and worshipped there.

The question derived from the above is: how can a route planner, optimally plan the delivery points of a driver 
so that the distance covered, to pass through its designated coffee shops, is the best possible.
